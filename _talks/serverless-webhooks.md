At Dwolla, we send millions of webhooks a week. We recently rearchitected from
a single shared queue serviced by a cluster of Scala workers to a queue and
TypeScript Lambda worker per partner. This increased reliability, decreased
costs, and cut delays from 60 minutes during peak load to under one. Join us for
valuable lessons learned and a walkthrough of the open-sourced code!

Please be sure to sign up ahead of time to simplify registration for a badge.
Paid hourly parking is available at the 9th and Locust ramp. The Dwolla office
is accessible with a short walk through the skywalk from the garage. Metered
street parking is also available.
