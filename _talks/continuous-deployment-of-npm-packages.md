Keeping up with the fast-paced releases of node packages can be overwhelming. A
project is often left with the choice of wasting many hours simply bumping package
versions or letting their long list of dependencies get further and futher out of
date. With so much talk of JS fatigue, it can be hard to believe that the same
community has also produced many tools that can actually make your life easier in
ways that are unmatched in other tech stacks.

This talk will focus on the use of a combination of available OSS tools that can
help to automate away some of the most tedious tasks of maintaining a JavaScript
project. Continuous deployment is a lofty goal for applications, but we will even
discuss continuous-deployment for internal packages.
