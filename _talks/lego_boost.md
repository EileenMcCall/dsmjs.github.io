I've been playing with the Lego Boost robotics platform lately to build a remote control for the Boost Move Hub using Angular 7, TypeScript, and Node.js. The Boost Move Hub communicates with an app or the PC through a Bluetooth Low Energy connection. I thought the community would enjoy learning about what Iâ€™ve learned in the process and some of the potential for automated Lego creations.
