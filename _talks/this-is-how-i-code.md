Come checkout how I code my React/Redux projects. I'll be going over the architecture, project organization, libraries, and common patterns that I use to build developer friendly, scalable, reusable, and organized projects. Tutorials out there are great for learning React/Redux and small applications, but I'm going to dig deeper to show you how to create code that will last. (Some React/Redux experience is encouraged).
