## Elm
Elm is a function language that is transpiled into Javascript.  Elm has helpful error messages, no runtime exceptions, and is fast.  In this talk I will give an overview of Elm and show its advantages over other frameworks and languages.

**Carl Olson** is an Artisan at Pillar Technology.  He enjoys studying functional programming and new computer languages.

## Aurelia: rediscover your choice in front-end frameworks
It's 2017 and the choice of front-end frameworks seems endless, and yet somehow not a choice at all. React and Angular dominate every conversation surrounding mature, robust, and accessible frameworks. But I went searching for something that values standards over configuration, flexibility over opinion, and accessibility over memorization. My search ended with Aurelia and I'd like to introduce you to it.

**Jeff Shinrock** is the Lead Software Engineer at WorkHound (founded in Des Moines, currently based in Chattanooga, Tennessee). With a passion for all things web development, he has contributed to numerous Iowa technology companies - including Workiva (WebFilings), Bunchball Iowa, Brewd, and Men's Style Lab. 


## Marble testing in RxJS
**TBD** ;)

**Eric Ponto** all things JS.
