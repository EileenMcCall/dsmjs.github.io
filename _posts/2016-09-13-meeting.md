### Refactor Like a Scientist

Tests are a good baseline for defining the behavior of a program. Though, on complicated programs, are tests enough?

[Scientist](https://github.com/trello/scientist) is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) library for creating and running experiments between old and new pieces of code. Scientist makes it easy to refactor critical code paths with confidence. It safely exposes refactorings to actual production interactions and measures potential mismatches. Part experience report, refactoring discussion, and workshop, this talk will also explore safe refactoring techniques at companies like Trello and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
