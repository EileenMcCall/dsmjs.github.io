### First Topic * KnockoutJS

Love MVVM? Hate storing state in the DOM and complex DOM manipulation? Don't want to deal with Angular's routes, modules and service factory factories? Want excellent browser compatibility? Knockout JS just may be what you're looking for. Swing by this session and let Knockout knock your socks off.

### Last Topic * Using ES6 modules today

Do you want to use the next generation of javascript modules today? Join me for a live coding session where I show how to write es6 modules and transpile them to AMD. Specifically I'll be showing off the grunt-es6-module-transpiler. If we have time I'll also show a bower demo where you can install and import modules on demand without having to worry about order dependent scripts (even for scripts with nested dependencies).
