### Javascript in the Cloud - AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda allows you to define and run state-free Javascript functions on Amazon Cloud Compute resources as a more flexible way to scale your Javascript without incurring the costs and ops headaches that go along with orchestrating server infrastructure. In this talk we will explore how to configure new functions to run on demand and discuss the options that you as a developer have to execute them. A familiarity with AWS vocabulary is helpful but not required for this talk.
