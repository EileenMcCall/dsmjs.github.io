### Intro Topic * Chrome dev tools tips and tricks

[Torey Maerz](https://twitter.com/toreym) will start off the meeting
with a quick 30 minute tips and tricks overview for developing and
debugging in chrome dev tools. He'll cover some helpful development
workflow tips to help you work more efficiently, show you how you
can use the profiler and network tabs to find inefficiencies in your
code, and even some newer items just added to dev tools.

Torey previously lead a UI dev team at [Principal](http://http://www.principal.com/)
and was the CIO at [Appcore](http://www.appcore.com/) before starting
his own software company, C5 Software.


### Advanced Topic * Using Backbone to Visualize Music

For this talk, I'm thinking Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger -- using
Backbone to visualize music. I'll demonstrate how to use routers,
models, and views to do some cool stuff -- like making a media player
that can pick up where you left off, visualize the music to which you
are listening, and manage a music library -- ya know, non-crud stuff.
