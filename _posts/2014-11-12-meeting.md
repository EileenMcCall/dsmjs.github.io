### Javascript Cryptography
Advances in JavaScript cryptography have resulted in several libraries made available that can perform client side encryption.  We’ll look at two of the most common, SJCL and CryptoJS, along with the WebCrypto API that the W3C is currently drafting.  Finally, we’ll look at the practical applications and pitfalls of using client side encryption and discuss real world use cases.  

[Nick Starke](https://twitter.com/nstarke) is an information security developer with an interest in all things crypto.


### Intro To ES6
Sometimes with JavaScript you have to write some funky code and we all just accept it, because that's the way it is. Want to loop over the `arguments` passed into a function? Better use `Array.protototype.slice` on that bad boy first. Trying to do inheritance? Good luck.

With the next generation of the language, some of these common problems become very easy. In this talk, we'll go over some of the new features of JavaScript and how to start using them today.
