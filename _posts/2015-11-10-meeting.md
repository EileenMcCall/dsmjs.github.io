### It hurts....so Good :)

While the bleeding-edge can be painful, there is an incredible amount of power to be found
in future versions of javascript.  We will be showing off some of the techniques and tools
that TelePharm has been using to increase our productivity (We'd be going much faster if it wasn't for the new guy.) and code clarity as we build the next version of our application. Specifically, we will be
demonstrating some useful patterns that have been previously unavailable in the javascript ecosystem.


[Caleb Boyd](https://github.com/calebboyd) and [Dusty Greif](https://github.com/dgreif) are software engineers serially working in the start-up arena. Before starting at TelePharm, they created Keepalo, which failed. (because startups do that sometimes) Both can be found at [@calebboyd](https://github.com/calebboyd) and [@dgreif](https://github.com/dgreif) on github.
