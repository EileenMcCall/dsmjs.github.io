### Intro Topic * Working with files in the browser

Reading and manipulating files has traditionally been a job for the server. But with new JavaScript APIs, it opens a world of possibilities to work with files in the browser. Get a quick introduction to the File API, the FileReader object, and see a couple of cool things you can do with them.

His life pretty much revolves around the 3 Fs: family, football, and front-end development (not necessarily in that order, depending on the day).

### Advanced Topic * Introduction to ClojureScript

ClojureScript compiles [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) to optimized JavaScript. Specifically, the compiler emits JavaScript compatible with the advanced compilation mode of [Google Closure](http://code.google.com/closure/).

We'll start with an introduction to [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), assuming no prior knowledge of the language. Clojure is a dynamic, general purpose programming language (actually a Lisp dialect) that features a rich set of immutable data structures, lazy sequences, first-class functions, macros, and other features.

Then we'll look at ClojureScript, which compiles Clojure code to optimized JavaScript that can be used on a web page or run in another JavaScript environment such as [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

We'll cover

* Setting up a simple ClojureScript project
* ClojureScript build process, including compilation modes
* JavaScript Interop

If time permits, we'll look at the new [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) library that provides a solution to "callback hell."
