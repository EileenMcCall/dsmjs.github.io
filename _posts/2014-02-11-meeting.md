### IndexedDB Fundamentals

For this presentation, we will focus primarily on client-side usage of IndexedDB; specifically, a brief technical overview, then lots of “live coding” to show the syntax for CRUD operations on the client side as well as demonstrate the transactional system that is fundamental to IndexedDB.  We’ll look at the tools available in Chrome to help debug / analyze / manipulate data, and then finish up by a brief discussion of real-world use cases, as well as limitations of IndexedDB.

Nicholas Starke is a Haskell / JavaScript programmer who enjoys pushing the envelope with JS by working on weird things like using javascript in embedded systems and synthesizing audio signals in the browser to create music compositions. Oh, and “vi forever”.

Note - pizza will be provided @ 6pm
