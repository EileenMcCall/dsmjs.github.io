### Intro Topic * What is "this" ?

Part of JavaScript’s charm and elegance stems from the fact that it works quite a bit differently than most other languages. The “this” keyword is one of the parts of JavaScript that seems to behave perhaps a bit differently than what might be expected. In addition to the “this” keyword, I will discuss execution contexts, the “new” operator, the call, apply and bind functions, and strict mode.

### Advanced Topic * Writing tests for javascript with QUnit/Sinon and Karma

So you want to write a single page app with your javascript framework of choice, but how do you test these rich web applications? Join me for a discussion about my frontend testing journey and a hands on demo of QUnit/Sinon and the Karma test runner. Some basic understanding of unit testing is recommended but not required.
