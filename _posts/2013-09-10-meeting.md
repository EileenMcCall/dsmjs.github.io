### Intro Topic * github and the open source ecosphere

If you've been attending user group meetings, or just had someone forward you a GitHub URL - you've seen some of the things that developers have been doing in the Open Source community. In this session, I'll talk about open source development, the GitHub ecosphere and how you can get involved. Along the way, we'll share some success stories (and not so successful stories) about getting involved in the community, how you can make positive contributions and what to expect when you start your own open source project.

### Advanced Topic * Intro to Grunt: Stop doing things manually

Grunt is a Javascript Task Runner. If you've never heard of Grunt then this presentation is for you. Grunt can help you automatically compile Less/Coffeescript, compile templates, aggregate/minify files, and much more . Don't worry though, you don't have to run Grunt every time you want it to do something. I'll show you the Grunt Watch feature, so you can code faster.
