### Do's and Don'ts of High Performance JavaScript: How WebFilings New Open Source Project Improves the Mobile Experience

HTML5 is progressing fast, and so is the performance of mobile devices.  However it is still a challenge to build ‘native’ like UI with HTML and JavaScript on mobile. 

The topic of discussion will be around using a brand new virtualized scrolling component as a case study. This ScrollList component is intended to provide near-native performance for huge amounts of content in an application built entirely on HTML5 and JavaScript.

This ScrollList component is the first component to be released as part of Web UIComponents - a library developed internally at WebFilings, but now being released as an Open Source project.

Presented by [Tim McCall](https://github.com/mccalltd). Tim is a Senior Software Engineer at WebFilings in charge of our mobile document viewer initiative. Tim is also responsible for the Attribute Routing project which was incorporated by Microsoft into ASP.NET MVC 5.
