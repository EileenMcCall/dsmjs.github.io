### `React.render(ClientOrServer, document.querySelector(‘.you-decide’));`

It is hard to read any JavaScript news without mention of ReactJS. This talk is an introduction to React and why it's awesome. We will talk about the Virtual DOM, the data flow, and where it fits in the JavaScript stack. I will share some of my experiences with React both best practices and future plans.
