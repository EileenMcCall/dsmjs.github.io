### Writing your first react component

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's declarative, efficient, and extremely flexible. But what does all this mean exactly? Join me for a live coding session where I show off a few of the basic concepts required to write your first react component!

### Building your web apps with gulp

Does your web app require a build step of some kind? Is the declarative style used by grunt not your thing? Looking for a build tool made for the javascript developer? Join me for a live coding session where I create a simple gulp build that includes a JSX transform / ES6 transpile and even a simple concat step!

### Browserify basics

Are you looking for an easy way to bundle your javascript apps while allowing your team to leverage all of npm at the same time? Are you a fan of CJS style modules in javascript? Join me for a live coding session where I discuss my love/hate relationship with browserify!
