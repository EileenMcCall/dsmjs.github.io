### React / Routing / Lazy Loading and ES6

On the surface web components seem like a great way to get started, but as your JavaScript application grows how do you compose them together in a maintainable way? How can you add client side routing to keep your application from breaking the web? What about lazy loading entire modules inside your application on the fly? Join me for a live coding session where I show all the above incrementally by building out a JavaScript application with react and the react-router!
